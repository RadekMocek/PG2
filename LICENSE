This Visual Studio C++ project located in the `PG2/` directory (hereinafter referred to as the "Project") was used to practice creating a 3D OpenGL application in C++. The Project was for educational purposes only, was never monetized, and its binary version was never distributed in any way. The Project uses third-party assets located in the `PG2/resources/` directory. For more information, see the _## Sources ##_ section in the README.

The Project uses third-party libraries, which, except for OpenCV, are included in this repository:

* [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) ([zlib/libpng](https://www.glfw.org/license))
* [GLEW](https://glew.sourceforge.net/) ([Modified BSD](https://github.com/nigels-com/glew/blob/master/LICENSE.txt))
* [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) ([MIT](https://github.com/g-truc/glm/blob/master/copying.txt))
* [IrrKlang](https://www.ambiera.com/irrklang/index.html) ([Custom](https://www.ambiera.com/irrklang/license.html))
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) ([Apache 2.0](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/LICENSE))

`PG2/AppHeightmap.cpp` is inspired by section in [_CIS 580 Textbook_](https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis580/) by _Nathan Bean_ written for the _Kansas State University_, which is under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). However, the code was independently implemented after studying a given concept, so it should not be considered an adaptation of an existing work.
