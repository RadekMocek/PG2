## Assignment ##

ESSENTIALS:
* [X] 3D GL Core profile + shaders at least 4.5, GL debug
* [X] high performance => at least 60 FPS
* [X] allow VSync control, fullscreen vs. windowed switching (restore window position & size)
* [X] event processing (camera, object, app behaviour...): mouse (both axes, wheel), keyboard
* [X] multiple different independently moving 3D models, at leats two loaded from file
* [X] at least three different textures (or subtextures from texture atlas etc.)
* [X] lighting model, at least 3 lights (ambient+directional+reflector: at least one is moving; + possible other lights)
* [X] correct full scale transparency (at least one transparent object; NOT if(alpha<0.1) {discard;} )

EXTRAS:
* [X] height map textured by height & proper player height coords
* [~] working collisions (only projectiles x environment)
* [ ] particles
* [ ] scripting (useful, e.g. Lua)
* [X] audio (better than just background)

INSTAFAIL:
* using GLUT, GL compatible profile
```
